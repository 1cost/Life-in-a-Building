Building Ecosystem Traffic Analyzer (BETA)

-------------------------
Building Ecosystem Traffic Analyzer (BETA) is a system that will aim to provide insight into patterns of life in designated areas by leveraging analysis of camera footage. This will be accomplished by utilizing Naval Academy footage of various public Midshipman spaces such as: Steerage, Mac D weight room, and the mailroom. BETA will use a pre-trained, user-created model to perform object detection on objects of interest from camera footage. BETA will count the detection of objects in order to characterize traffic flow over time.
