Building Ecosystem Traffic Analyzer (BETA)

-------------------------
Building Ecosystem Traffic Analyzer (BETA) is a system that will aim to provide insight into patterns of life in designated areas by leveraging analysis of camera footage. This will be accomplished by utilizing Naval Academy footage of various public Midshipman spaces such as: 7th Wing Weight Room, Macdonough Hall Weight room, and the barbershop. BETA will use a pre-trained, user-created model to perform object detection on objects of interest from camera footage as well as a motion detection system to measure traffic. BETA will count the detection of objects in conjunction with activity measured by the motion sensor system to characterize traffic in the mentioned spaces over time.
